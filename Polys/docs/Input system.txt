So, the way in which input is gathered and processed is slightly complicated ^^ So I will describe it here briefly. Note that it may be slighly outdated :b

Key-Intent bindings are processed from the main configuration file. They are stored in the Input class.

The Input class checks processes keys an determines which intents should be active during a particular frame. Objects inside the system can query these intents. Intents are not sent out automatically to avoid unwanted execution in an inactive state.
