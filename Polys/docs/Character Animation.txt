When creating a character, one has to create the sprite sheet according to a layout in order for an animation to
be correctly interpreted by the game. This is the layout, with optional components being inside a [] block ^_^
A row with a + sign after it means that this row may be repeated multiple times.

The sprite sheet itself is a matrix where each column is a direction, and each row is a frame.
Note that ultimately some things will have to be specified in code, such as how many idle frames there are ^^
That's a trivial task that I'll likely move to a LUA script.
