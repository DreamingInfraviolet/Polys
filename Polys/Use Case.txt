Use case scenario ( :P ):

The player starts the game (duh)
The configuration file is read and used to initialise the application
The player sees a fun little menu :3 They can click New Game, Load, Options and Quit. This is the MenuMode of the game (there are multiple modes implemented as interface-deriving classes)
They click New Game, and the game begins.
The screen fades in using a post-filter.
An intro cinematic is played - recall that the whole system is parameter and event based.
Characters move around and perform dialogue. Input is in dialogue mode - pressing one of the Skip buttons hurries a dialogue. Between dialogues, actors walk around, the scenes change, and items are picked up - can be achieved using non-player character controllers.
The user can now play the game (PlayMode) - they can walk (up,down,left,right,topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright) and interact with interactible entities.
They interact with a vial, picking it up.
They press I to see their inventory (InventoryMode), and select the vial. They can either Drop it (it weighs stuff), investigate it, or drink it. They drink it, and their HP is restored.
They leave the Inventory, back to the GameMode to see their full HP.
They walk towards a door (the rest of the room is in darkness) and interact with it. If they have drunk the vial, they get to go outside. Otherwise they don't :b (just an example!)
They go outside, and it's raining! They are now wet (global Player property mapping)
